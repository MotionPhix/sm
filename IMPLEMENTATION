## Milestones/Epics
1. Foundation & Tenancy Hardening
- [x] Enforce scoping & middleware; audit logs; baseline tests

2. Onboarding Wizard & School Switcher
- [x] Full setup flow; gating; defaults (onboarding middleware present; flows partially implemented)

3. Academic Year/Terms/Calendar + Timetable & Attendance
- [x] Year/term lifecycle; timetable; attendance MVP (clash detection, daily attendance with validation, TypeScript UI)

4. Gradebook, Grading Scales, Reports (PDF)
- [ ] Assessments, computation, PDFs

5. Admissions & Student Lifecycle
- [~] Applications→enrollment; transfers; student profiles (admissions UI + models; enrollment linkage pending)

6. Finance & Accounting + Payments
- [x] Fee items/structures setup - COMPLETED
- [ ] Invoicing, payments, arrears, accounting

7. Communications & Portals
- [~] Messaging; noticeboard; parent/student portals (invitation email; portal routes scaffolded)

8. Analytics & Compliance Exports
- [ ] Dashboards; EMIS/government exports

9. Localization, Backups, Observability

---

## Risks & Edge Cases
- [ ] Cross-tenant data leakage via caching/exports/logs
- [ ] Mid-term enrollments with fee proration and partial assessments
- [ ] Late grade edits after publication (lock & audit)
- [ ] Payment reconciliation mismatches/chargebacks
- [x] Teacher timetable clashes and last-minute changes — TimetableService validates clashes, TeacherAssignment model prevents saving conflicting schedules
- [ ] Transfers between streams/classes mid-term and promotions rules
- [ ] SMS deliverability/latency and cost management

## KPIs
- [ ] Time to onboard a new school (< 30 min)
- [ ] Attendance capture time per class (< 2 min)
- [ ] Report card generation throughput (queued PDFs/min)
- [ ] Payment reconciliation accuracy (> 99.5%)
- [ ] System error rate (< 0.1%) & P95 page load time

## Notes
- Use queues for heavy tasks (PDFs, imports, notifications)
- Tag logs with `school_id`, `user_id`, `academic_year_id`
- Prefer repository/service patterns for scoping and testability

## Next Phase Recommendation: Student Enrollment Management

Based on the current state, the most logical next module to implement is **Student Enrollment Management** because:

1. **Dependencies are ready**: 
   - Academic years, terms, classes, streams are fully set up
   - Fee structures are configured
   - Admission cycles and applicants exist

2. **Natural workflow progression**:
   - Admissions → Applicants → Enrollment is the natural flow
   - Currently, applicants exist but cannot be converted to enrolled students
   - This bridges the gap between admissions and the academic system

3. **Enables downstream features**:
   - Attendance recording requires enrolled students
   - Gradebook needs enrolled students
   - Finance/invoicing needs student enrollments

4. **Core business value**:
   - Without enrollment, the system cannot track actual students
   - This is the critical link between prospective and active students

### Student Enrollment Implementation Scope:

**Backend:**
- [ ] Create enrollment from admitted applicant
- [ ] Bulk enrollment import (CSV)
- [ ] Enrollment validation (class capacity, duplicate checks)
- [ ] Fee assignment on enrollment (link to fee structures)
- [ ] Enrollment history tracking
- [ ] Transfer between classes/streams
- [ ] Withdrawal/de-enrollment

**Frontend:**
- [ ] Enrollment management UI (list, create, edit)
- [ ] Applicant-to-student conversion flow
- [ ] Bulk import interface
- [ ] Enrollment reports

**Tests:**
- [ ] Enrollment creation tests
- [ ] Validation rule tests
- [ ] Bulk import tests
- [ ] Transfer/withdrawal tests
